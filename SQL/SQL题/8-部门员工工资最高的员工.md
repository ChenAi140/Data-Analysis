## 三、解答SQL

### 1. 方法1
&emsp;&emsp;dense_rank() over()
```sql
SELECT
    Department,
    Employee,
    Salary
FROM (
        SELECT
            d.name AS Department,
            e.name AS Employee,
            salary AS Salary,
            dense_rank() over(
                partition by departmentId
                order by salary desc
            ) AS rr
        FROM Department AS d
            RIGHT JOIN Employee AS e ON d.id = e.departmentId
    ) AS temp
WHERE rr = 1;
```

### 2. 方法2
&emsp;&emsp;JOIN、
```sql
SELECT
    d.name AS Department,
    e.name AS Employee,
    salary AS Salary
FROM Department AS d
    JOIN Employee AS e ON d.id = e.departmentId
WHERE (DepartmentId, Salary) IN (
        SELECT
            departmentId,
            max(salary)
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY departmentId
    );
```

### 3. 方法3

&emsp;&emsp;JOIN、ALL
```sql
SELECT
    d.name AS Department,
    e.name AS Employee,
    e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee AS e
    JOIN Department AS d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE e.salary >= ALL(
        SELECT
            t.salary
        FROM
            Employee AS t
        WHERE
            e.departmentId = t.departmentId
    );
```
